Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
---
Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.


---
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 20.
